- 👋 Hi, I’m @scm288
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python, with a long-term goal in employment opportunities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Git.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at the moment, unless you want to offer some sweet tips for getting into programming--good books to read, tutorials to check out, or websites to take a look at.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
Email me at scm288@gmail.com
